# Missing-data-and-measurement-error

This repository contains the files both to 

1) reproduce all analysis in the article *A joint Bayesian framework for missing data and measurement error using integrated nested Laplace approximations*, 
2) generate the website https://emmaskarstein.github.io/Missing-data-and-measurement-error/. 

The website is made using Quarto, and the compiled html-files can be found in the folder called `docs`. I recommend opening the file at `docs/index.html` to get started!

If you prefer looking directly at/running `R`-scripts, you can clone this repository and run the `R`-scripts in the folder called `R`. These `R`-scripts are automatically generated from the Quarto documents using `knitr::purl`.

Please see the website for further guidance.
